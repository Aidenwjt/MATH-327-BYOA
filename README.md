## Program Ideas:
- Calculate and plot the first n perfect numbers
- Visualizing congruence classes
- Implement a prime sieve --> visual or computational
- Compare runtimes of prime generation, plot runtimes
- LDE solver --> EEA implementation
- RSA ALG (Related to Primes)

## Implemented Programs (Aiden):
- 2 Variable LDE Solver (ALMOST DONE)
- Divisor Power Sum Solver (DONE)
- Simple Ford Circle Drawer (ALMOST DONE but might scrap since GUIs are cringe)
- Linear Congruence Solver (Possibly use LDE solver with this)
- Combine a few solvers into a library
- Something later in the course

## Implemented Programs (Noah):
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (DONE) Possibility of GUI
- Sieve of Sundaram (Build) Same as Eratosthenes, get it working, then look to expand it
- Something from later in the course

## Program Ideas:
- Calculate and plot the first n perfect numbers
- Visualizing congruence classes
- Implement a prime sieve --> visual or computational
- Compare runtimes of prime generation, plot runtimes
- LDE solver --> EEA implementation
- RSA ALG (Related to Primes)

## Implemented Programs (Aiden):
- 2 Variable LDE Solver (Almost  done, need to add negative constants use case)
- Linear Congruence Solver (Possibly use LDE solver with this?)
- Diffie-Hellman protocol, simulate the creation of a symmetric key using Miller-Rabin? (In Progress)
- Divisor Power Sum Solver (DONE, probably won't use)
- Combine a few solvers into a library?

## Implemented Programs (Noah):
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (DONE) Possibility of GUI
- Sieve of Sundaram (Build) Same as Eratosthenes, get it working, then look to expand it
- Something from later in the course

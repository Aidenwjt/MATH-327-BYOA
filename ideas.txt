My Program Ideas:
- Calculate and plot the first n perfect numbers
- Wilson's Theorem plotting p-gons
- Visualizing congruence classes


- Implement a prime seive --> visual or computational?
- Compare runtimes of prime generation, plot runtimes
- LDE solver --> EEA implementation
- RSA ALG (Related to Primes)
